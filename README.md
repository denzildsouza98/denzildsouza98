# 🚀 Tales from My Career Adventures

## Turning Data into a Neurodivergent-Friendly Ally (University of Washington)  
Picture this: I’m staring at rows of messy survey data, armed with nothing but Python and determination. My mission? Help a research team uncover why neurodivergent candidates often feel like they’re auditioning for a role in *Mission Impossible* during interviews. After hours of wrangling unruly data and coaxing it into shape, I whipped up **Tableau dashboards** that told a clear story. One surprise plot twist? There was a massive gap in perceived support during interviews! Armed with these insights, the team rolled out actionable recommendations that didn’t involve spy gadgets.  

## Last-Mile Delivery: Data’s Epic Journey (Amazon Capstone)  
Amazon delivery isn’t just about getting a package to your door; it’s a saga of countless data points racing against time. I was the data whisperer who optimized workflows by building an **AWS RDS-based data warehouse** and automating **ETL pipelines with Glue**. For added flair, I taught **AWS Lambda** to file and archive like a pro librarian, cutting operational chaos. The result? A system so efficient it felt like delivery trucks were running on jet fuel.  

## Dashboard Detective: The Case of the Missing Efficiency (Matson)  
At Matson, I became a dashboard detective. Armed with **Tableau**, I uncovered bottlenecks in warehousing and transportation operations like a modern Sherlock Holmes. The result? A 15% improvement in efficiency! When the data got too big for spreadsheets, I turned to **PySpark**, wrangling it into insights faster than you can say “analytics.” It’s safe to say my dashboards were the Watson to my Holmes.  

## The Art of Automation: A Data Opera (BNP Paribas)  
Imagine a symphony of operational workflows—each instrument out of tune. That’s where I stepped in at BNP Paribas. With **Kibana** and **Grafana**, I gave teams real-time visibility into system performance, cutting troubleshooting time by 25%. I automated over 2,000 ETL jobs using **Autosys** and Oracle Data Integrator, eliminating bottlenecks like a virtuoso conductor. Using **PySpark** and **Cassandra**, I crafted big data insights that hit the right notes for asset management. For the grand finale, I wrote efficient stored procedures in **SSMS**, optimizing database performance and ensuring decision-makers always had the perfect data crescendo.
