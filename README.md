### ðŸš€ **Stories from My Career:**  

#### **Shaping Inclusivity Through Data (University of Washington)**  
Working with survey data, I helped a research team uncover gaps in the hiring process for neurodivergent individuals. Using Python, I performed data wrangling to clean and standardize the data, ensuring it was reliable. I then developed **Tableau dashboards** to visually communicate key trends, enabling the team to focus on the most impactful areas for improvement. One finding revealed a significant mismatch in perceived support during the interview process, which has since informed actionable recommendations.  

#### **Improving Delivery Operations at Scale (Amazon Capstone)**  
At Amazon, I tackled the challenge of optimizing data workflows for last-mile delivery. By designing an **AWS RDS-based data warehouse** and automating **ETL pipelines with Glue**, I ensured data was seamlessly integrated from various sources. I also utilized **AWS Lambda** to automate file archiving and management, reducing operational overhead and improving efficiency.  

#### **Creating Operational Dashboards (Matson)**  
I developed **Tableau dashboards** to track warehousing and transportation metrics, uncovering bottlenecks and driving a 15% improvement in operational efficiency. Additionally, I leveraged **PySpark** to handle large-scale data transformations, enabling faster analytics and better insights.  

#### **Optimizing Monitoring and Automation (BNP Paribas)**  
At BNP Paribas, I transformed operational workflows into streamlined, data-driven systems. I developed dynamic dashboards with **Kibana** and **Grafana**, cutting troubleshooting time by 25% and giving teams real-time visibility into system performance. By automating over 2,000 ETL jobs using **Autosys** and Oracle Data Integrator, I eliminated bottlenecks and ensured smoother data processing.
Working with **PySpark** and **Cassandra**, I harnessed big data to generate actionable insights for asset management, empowering decision-makers with real-time analytics. Additionally, I optimized database performance by creating efficient stored procedures in **SSMS**, enhancing query speed and data accuracy. Together, these efforts drove efficiency, reliability, and impactful decision-making across critical processes.
