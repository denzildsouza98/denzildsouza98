💬 **Ask Me About:**

👨‍💻 **Experience:**

### My experience working as a Software Engineer at Matson

- **What I did:** As a Software Engineer at Matson, I dived into the world of requirement analysis for 20 use cases. It was all about making sure they seamlessly integrated into our business application. Ever migrated 40 business reports from SSRS to Jasper Software? Well, I did, and it was part of a pretty cool transformation project.
  
- **Testing, Testing:** Of course, after developing and migrating those reports, there was a fair bit of testing to do. Unit testing and UAT testing for all 40 reports to be exact. Making sure everything stayed ship-shape!

### My journey as a Production Support Analyst at BNP Paribas

- **Cutting Manual Effort:** Ever wonder how to save 50 hours a month? Well, I developed and set up Monitoring and Alerting systems in Kibana and Graphana for a .NET application. It was a game-changer, reducing manual efforts and providing slick visual dashboards for the business.

- **Leading Continuity:** Also, led the charge in Business Continuity activities for 3 applications. From planning to execution, ensuring smooth DR and Live play. Because when it comes to backup servers, reliability is the name of the game.

- **Querying and Automating:** When it came to querying large datasets in MYSQL, Sybase, and Cassandra, I was the go-to person. Automated Intraday file integration tasks using Selenium and Autosys? Yeah, that was to save a solid 30 hours a month!

### My stint as a Full Stack Java Developer at TechSkills IT Consultants

- **Springing into Action:** Developed complex APIs via Spring MVC and Spring Boot to query different databases and generate reports. If you're into MYSQL databases, I've got some stories for you.

- **Queried like a Pro:** Queried MYSQL databases like a pro for client reports and created procedures for BAU activities. Because sometimes, you've got to dive into the data!

🚀 **Projects:**

### My exploration in Covid Vaccination Analysis using Tableau

- **Dashboard Dive:** Created Tableau dashboards to dive deep into historical trends in COVID vaccination. It was all about using advanced data visualization techniques to examine patterns based on GDP and population density.

### The Adventure of the Automatic Timetable Generator using Genetic Algorithm

- **Optimizing Timetables:** Built a cool open-source web app using React JS and Flask. How? Well, Genetic Algorithm was the secret sauce. It generated timetables considering hard and soft constraints, achieving an impressive 97% fitness rate.
